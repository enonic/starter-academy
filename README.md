# Enonic Academy starter

This starter kit serves as the base for all our developer courses at the Enonic Academy. It kickstarts the students with a few parts, content-types, a page, and also some content. It's loosely based on "[My First App](http://xp.readthedocs.org/en/6.8/tutorials/my-first-app/index.html)" from the documentation.

This software is made available as-is.

## How to use

Use this starter with the "init-project" feature in the Enonic XP toolbox. Or just download the zip-file of the project from Github and unpack anywhere locally, then run `gradlew deploy` command from any command line tool (make sure `$XP_HOME` variable is set first).
